# Introduction
The Tsimane Health and Life History Project (THLHP) is a groundbreaking biomedical research initiative studying the causes and effects of physiological aging in a non-industrialized population.
Working with the Tsimane—an indigenous group in Bolivia's lowlands—we investigate what healthy aging looked like prior to the industrial revolution, with a special focus on Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias, and cardiovascular health.
For over two decades, we have collected extensive longitudinal data ranging from demographic and economic information to genetic analyses and detailed medical imaging, making this one of anthropology's most comprehensive studies of health and aging.
